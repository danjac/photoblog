# AGENTS.md

This is a Django project using HTMX, AlpineJS, and Tailwind CSS. See `docs/` for detailed documentation on each part of the stack.

## General instructions: read first

When I ask you to STOP and LISTEN, or to DISCUSS before coding, do NOT run any commands or make any edits. Wait for explicit approval before taking action.

## Stack

- **Python 3.14**, **Django 6.0**, **PostgreSQL 18**, **Redis 8**
- **Frontend**: HTMX + AlpineJS + Tailwind CSS (no JS build step; Tailwind compiled via `django-tailwind-cli`)
- **Package manager**: `uv` (not pip/poetry)
- **Task runner**: `just` (run `just` with no arguments to list all commands)
- **Background tasks**: Django Tasks (`django-tasks-db`), not Celery

**NOTE**: Python 3.14 and Django 6.0 are valid and exist. Do not flag syntax or features from these versions as errors based on knowledge cutoff assumptions.

## Project Layout

> **Documentation convention:** code examples in `docs/` and `.agents/skills/` use these placeholders — substitute with your actual values:
>
> - `my_package` → `photoblog` (root Python package, used in imports and file paths)
> - `my_app` → an arbitrary Django sub-app within `my_package` (e.g. `users`, `posts`, `comments`)
> - `my_project` → `photoblog` (project root directory, Docker image name, service name)
> - `my_domain.com` → your actual domain name

```
config/             # Django settings, URLs, ASGI/WSGI
photoblog/              # Main application package
  users/            # User model, authentication
  db/               # Database utilities (search mixin)
  http/             # HTTP utilities (typed requests, responses, decorators)
  partials.py       # render_partial_response() - HTMX partial swap helper
  paginator.py      # render_paginated_response() + no-COUNT Paginator
  tests/            # Shared test fixtures
templates/          # Django templates (HTMX partials + full pages)
static/             # Static assets
conftest.py         # Root pytest config (fixture plugins)
```

## Commands

```bash
just check-all          # lint → typecheck → manage.py check → test-all — run before committing
just test               # unit tests with coverage
just test-e2e           # Playwright E2E tests (headless)
just serve              # dev server + Tailwind watcher
just dj <command>       # any manage.py command (e.g. just dj migrate)
just start / just stop  # Docker services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Mailpit)
```

Run `just` with no arguments for the full command list.

### Production commands (`r` prefix)

All production commands use the `r` prefix and are gated with an interactive confirmation
prompt. When running them inside a skill (where the user has already confirmed intent),
use `just --yes` to suppress the prompt:

```bash
just --yes rkube get pods          # run kubectl without re-prompting
just --yes rdj migrate             # run manage.py on production
```

Skills that need kubectl beyond these two recipes should call `kubectl` directly.
Skill scripts (e.g. `.agents/skills/dj-db-restore/bin/`) handle kubeconfig resolution
internally.

Human-invoked commands (typed directly in the terminal) do not need `--yes` — the
confirmation is the intended safety gate.

Tests live in `photoblog/**/tests/`; framework: `pytest`+`pytest-django`; E2E tests marked `@pytest.mark.e2e`.

## Git Workflow

Conventional commits enforced by commitlint. Format: `type: subject`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

## Code Style

**Python style**: See `docs/python-style-guide.md`. Critical gotcha: `pyupgrade --py314` rewrites `except (E1, E2):` to `except E1, E2:` (PEP 758) — **do not revert this**; it is correct Python 3.14 syntax.

**UI components**: Use [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/components/) for all component styling. Check daisyui.com/components before writing new markup — the component you need likely already exists. See `docs/design.md` and `docs/django-templates.md`.

**Icons**: Use `heroicons[django]` (already in `pyproject.toml`) for all icons. Never use character entities or emoji as icons. See `docs/design.md`.

**Frontend dependencies**: Never use CDNs or introduce npm/Node tooling. Vendor minified files into `static/vendor/`. Track all vendored deps in `vendors.json`; run `just dj sync_vendors` to check for and download updates. See `docs/frontend-dependencies.md` for the full format and workflow.

**Form rendering** — use the first option that fits:

1. `{{ form }}` — all fields, default order
2. `{{ form.field.as_field_group }}` — explicit field order or subset

Never use `{{ form.as_div }}` or `{% include "forms/partials.html" %}`.
See `docs/django-forms.md`.

**Internationalisation**: All user-visible text must be wrapped in translation functions. See `docs/django.md` for usage.

**Documentation**: When updating a `docs/` file, keep its `## Contents` table of contents in sync. If a doc lacks a ToC and has 8+ `##` sections or 250+ lines, add one below the intro paragraph.

## General Rules

STOP and ask before applying a fix. Before making any changes, state your hypothesis about
the root cause and which files you plan to modify. Wait for confirmation before proceeding.
If the user corrects you, re-read the relevant code/docs before responding.

Do not make excessive or environment-specific changes beyond what was requested. If the
user asks for a targeted edit, make only that edit. Ask before adding dev/staging/production
variants.

When the user corrects you or says 'stop', immediately stop, acknowledge the correction,
and re-examine the situation from scratch. Do not repeat the same approach or question the
user's stated facts.

## Working Conventions

### Required reading before implementation

**Read `docs/django.md` before starting any implementation.** It documents
installed apps, middleware order, settings conventions, admin patterns, and
migrations. It also indexes the focused docs below.

**Before starting any task, look up your task type in the table below and read
the listed doc(s) before writing any code.** The table is a lookup — use it
actively, not as background reading.

If a doc contradicts what you see in existing code, flag it — do not silently pick one.

- **Search before implementing** — search with `rg` or `ast-grep` for existing utilities. Check `photoblog/db/search.py`, `photoblog/http/`, `photoblog/partials.py`, and `photoblog/paginator.py` before writing new code.
- **Scope discipline** — only change what was explicitly requested.
- **One step at a time** — in multi-step skills, execute one sub-step at a time. Wait for user confirmation before proceeding to the next. Do not batch multiple questions or actions into a single response.
- **Diagnose before changing** — state your diagnosis with a file:line reference before editing.
- **Add imports and first usage in the same edit** — the pre-commit ruff hook strips unused imports immediately. Always add an import and its first usage together in a single edit.

### Template Tags

- **One library per app, named after the app** — `<app>/templatetags/<app>.py`, loaded via `{% load <app> %}`.
- **Test as plain Python functions** — `simple_tag` and `filter` wrap ordinary functions; import and call them directly in tests without instantiating `Template`/`Context`.
- **Tag tests live in `<app>/tests/test_template_tags.py`.**

## MCP Servers

The following MCP servers are configured in `.mcp.json` (gitignored, generated at project creation). They are available to Claude Code when the project is open.

| Server | When available | Capability |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------- |
| `postgres` | Always | Execute SQL, inspect schema, check migrations |
| `playwright` | Always | Browser automation, E2E test debugging |
| `django` | Always | Django shell: ORM queries, model introspection, arbitrary Python in Django context |
Use `postgres` and `django` to debug data issues. Use `playwright` to investigate E2E failures interactively.

See `docs/mcp.md` for details.

## Django

When working with Django migrations: use `reverse_code` (not `reverse_func`), never add
`--run-syncdb`, and confirm the makemigrations command with the user before running it.

For i18n/translation work, READ `docs/localization.md` before making any changes. Follow
the exact syntax patterns documented there. Do not claim templates are correct without
verifying against the docs.

## Deployment & Operations

When rotating secrets or credentials, ALWAYS verify the change worked before proceeding.
Never assume `ALTER ROLE`, password changes, or credential updates succeeded — run a
connection test. Update ALL references (`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, etc.) atomically.

## GitHub Issues

When asked to "fix all open issues": work on them ONE AT A TIME sequentially — do not use
parallel agents or worktrees. For each: create branch, fix, test, open PR, then move to
the next issue.

## Template Feedback

Generated from [django-studio](https://github.com/danjac/django-studio). To report a bug or improvement: `/dj-feedback`
